# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Purpose

We are tasked with getting employees in a company that are eligible for retirement. We will need to access the many databases given to us to form a table that we can use to determine who will be eligible, and how many will be retiring from each department of the company. Furthermore, we will also be getting the number of employees who are eligible for a mentorship program!

## Results

1. The amount of employees retiring from each department is quite the number. We can see this at a quick glance from this table.

2. The amount of employees eligible for the mentorship program per department can be seen here.

3. During the analysis, it was discovered that there were some possible errors in the data set provided since there were only five departments with active managers.

4. In all of the data for salaries, there appears to be a lack of raises for employees.

## Summary

There are a lot of roles to be filled with this upcoming massive wave of retirement, approximately 72,458 employees! We can see the number of employees per department in the first bullet point from our results.

Looking at the amount of eligible employees to mentor the next generation of employees from our second bullet point, and especially when we know the numbers of the retiring employees, it definitely seems like those who would be able to mentor the next generation would be absolutely overwhelmed due to how many will need to replace each department.

The best way that I can see an effective method of mentoring would be to trickle information down, starting with the mentor, to those they are personally mentoring, and have those who were mentored slowly teach those below them what they have a solid understanding of.
